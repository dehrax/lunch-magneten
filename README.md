# lunch-magneten

Okay, this repository is meant to display lunch.cf.

##Background
The initial version of this was written about three years ago in PHP. It is now 03:18 on a friday (that makes it saturday, technically), and this is about the third time people have contacted me about the site being down/spitting out error messages. So fuck it. Let's rewrite it from scratch. My thought is that we write only client-side code, so we are able to host the site on GitHub. Instant updates for the win! And people will be able to contribute.

##What's new?
So I am aiming for a really basic PWA-ish type of app. Offline availability, cached requests and homescreen icons. This means that at a bare minimum you will see a loading icon once each week. And teh rest is offline. Cool.

##Compability
Who the fuck knows. If it breaks it breaks. Post an issue on the repo or something like that...
